- When **legisCrawler** is running, you will be asked which term (2nd - 10th) you would like to scrape (please, type any single digit from 2 to 10). Then **legisCrawler** will automatically create a folder to restore the retrieval of parliamentary questions by individual member.

## What **legisCrawler** Scrapes
This designed crawler automatically webscrapes the parliamentary questions (專案質詢) from The Website of Legislative Yuan, including a bunch of information with regards to the topic, keywords and the type. An additional module for getting a corpus of grand parliamentary debates (總質詢) is in progress and will be available soon.
